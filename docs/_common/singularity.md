The *Blue Crab* cluster currently offers Singularity 2.6 on all compute nodes. We are in the process of upgrading our machine to allow users to take advantage of Singularity 3. When this software is ready, we will update this documentation.

To use singularity, simply run `ml singularity` and follow [the documentation](https://sylabs.io/guides/2.6/user-guide/). At present, users cannot build their own singularity containers without the assistance of our [software team](mailto:marcc-help@jhu.edu). Future Singularity builds will include options for building containers on MARCC, but in the meantime users are encouraged to use [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/).
