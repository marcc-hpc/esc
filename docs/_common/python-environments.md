This page explains the use of Python environments. Users who are interested in using `R` may also find the desciption of [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) useful.

*This page is under construction. More options coming soon. Check out [this site](https://marcc-hpc.github.io/tutorials/shortcourse_python.html) in the meantime.*

## Options for controlling Python environments {#options}

1. Use the default modules.
2. Install a `conda` environment sequentially.
3. [Use a custom `conda` environment](#conda).

## A. Custom conda environments {#conda}

Note that this is the best solution for users who need to control their Python (or `R`) version, install packages with `pip`, use interactive portal tools, or install `conda` packages from [Anaconda Cloud](https://anaconda.org/anaconda/python). The use of `conda env` ensures that you can generate your environment from an easily-portable text file. This also resolves version dependencies all at once, so that you don't paint yourself into a corner. (Users who experience perl version issues on *Blue Crab* should consult [this guide](perl-version-issue).)

### 1. Find a useful location to make an environment

Typically, the `conda create` command will make an environment in a hidden folder in your home directory, at `~/.conda`. These so-called "named" environments are suboptimal because you might forget about them and fill up your quota. It's much better to specify an absolute path to the environment so you always know where it is.

On *Blue Crab* we recommend that all users install to `~/` (your home directory, be mindful of the quota) or your shared group directory on our ZFS filesystem at `~/data`. The use of our Lustre system at `~/work` and `~/scratch` is discouraged because these installations create many small files and this filesystem is not optimal for repeatedly executing binaries.

Once you find a spot to install the environment, you can continue.

### 2. Prepare a requirements file

The requirements file consists of a `dependencies` list which enumerates the `conda` packages that you might typically install with `conda install`. You can specify a channel with the special syntax below (`::`) when packages are not available on the primary channel. We have also included `pip`, so that `conda` can also manage packages from [PyPI](https://pypi.org).

~~~
dependencies:
  - python=3.7
  - matplotlib
  - scipy
  - numpy
  - nb_conda_kernels
  - au-eoed::gnu-parallel
  - h5py
  - pip
  - pip:
    - sphinx
~~~

Save this as a text file called `reqs.yaml`. The file respects the [YAML](https://yaml.org/) format. Note that the use of `nb_conda_kernels` is necessary to use this environment in Jupyter on *Blue Crab*. Users who wish to later install their packages with `pip` should include it on the list. This will allow you to run `pip install` to add a package to this environment and avoid polluting your `~/.local` folder when using, `pip install --user`, which is a typical alternative.

### 3. Install the environment

We recommend choosing a useful name for your environment. This will help distingish your environment from others, in case you later use portal tools like Jupyter. Install Anaconda, or if you are using *Blue Crab*, load the anaconda module. Recall that `ml` is short for `module load` when using [Lmod](https://lmod.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

~~~ bash
ml anaconda
~~~

After selecting a name (`my_plot_env`), install the environment. If the environment installation is complex, you may wish to reserve a compute node.

~~~
conda env update --file reqs.yaml -p ./my_plot_env
~~~

After the environment is installed, you can use it in future terminal sessions or scripts using:

~~~
ml anaconda
conda activate ./path/to/my_plot_env
~~~

### 4. Benefits

The method above offers the following benefits:

1. You can repeatedly update `reqs.yaml` to add new packages, and then use the `conda env update` command above to add them to the environment. This helps to prevent version conflicts and makes your work more reproducible.
2. As long as you include `pip`, you can add packages like `sphinx` in the example requirements file. The `conda` program can manage packages from its own repositories as well as the python package index ([PyPI](https://pypi.org)).
3. The use if `nb_conda_kernels` will send a signal to Jupyter so you can use this environment inside a notebook.
4. Oftentimes conda packages are faster. You may notice that `numpy` uses the Intel MKL library, for example, which provides a large speedup for linear algebra calculations on some platforms.
